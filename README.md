This crate provides a generic [`embedded-hal`]-based driver for different
families of SPI Flash and EEPROM chips.

Right now, only 25-series Flash chips are supported. Feel free to send PRs to
support other families though!

Please refer to the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see what changed in the last
releases.
